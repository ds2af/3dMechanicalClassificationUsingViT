# 3dMechanicalClassificationUsingViT

Deep Learning (CSCI 7850) Project
This project aims to investigate the use of Vision Transformers for classifying 3D mechanical objects and compare their performance with CNN-based models. The main objective is to evaluate the suitability of ViTs for 3D object classification.

Aim 1: Classification of 3D mechanical objects using Vision Transformers. The goal is to apply Vision Transformers to classify 3D mechanical objects from the Traceparts dataset. The ViT will be trained on binarized voxel images, and its performance will be evaluated using accuracy and F1-score.

Aim 2: Comparative analysis of Vision Transformers and CNN models for 3D object classification. The study will compare the performance of ViTs with 2D and 3D CNN models to determine if ViTs can match or outperform CNNs in terms of classification accuracy and feature representation.
